  ## Description
  Welcome to the Eat-Da-Burgers app, which is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
  Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
  The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 
  the app is deployed on Heroku.
